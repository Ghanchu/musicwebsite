# musicwebsite
just a small music website that Im making for some friends using mongodb, node.js, js, html, and css
this project was very useful in helping me learn some of the basics of node as well as the use of apis. I also was able to implement some CRUD systems and learned how to use the DOM and css. The backend was also made using mongoDB which taught me a lot about nonrelational databases.
This can be considered full stack, and i'm proud of the fact that I made something like this work. This is just a start however. I will remake this application from the ground up using REACT native as the frontend this time
I really want to get a good full for how that works
